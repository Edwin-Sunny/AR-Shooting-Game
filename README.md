# 3D AR Spider Shooting Game

## Overview

This project is a 3D Augmented Reality (AR) game developed using Unity. The game features multiple 3D models of spiders that are generated on a flat surface in the real world through AR. The player can interact with the spiders by tapping on them, which shoots and eliminates the spiders, thereby increasing their score. The spiders can also respawn after being shot, providing continuous gameplay. This game has a similar interaction style to Pokémon Go, leveraging AR to create an immersive experience.

## Features

- **Augmented Reality Gameplay:** The game utilizes AR to generate 3D spider models on real-world surfaces, creating an immersive environment.
- **Interactive Shooting Mechanism:** Players can tap on the spiders to shoot them, which will increase their score.
- **Dynamic Respawn System:** Spiders respawn after being shot, allowing for continuous gameplay and increasing difficulty.
- **Point System:** A point system is integrated, rewarding players for each spider they successfully shoot.
- **Real-World Interaction:** The game requires players to move around and interact with their environment, making it a physically engaging experience.

## How It Works

1. **Initialization:** Upon launching the app, the AR camera is activated. The player is prompted to point the camera at a flat surface, such as a table or floor.
2. **Surface Detection:** The game uses AR surface detection to identify a suitable flat surface where the spiders will be generated.
3. **Spider Generation:** Once a flat surface is detected, multiple 3D spider models are generated on the surface in random locations.
4. **Gameplay:** The player can tap on the spiders to shoot them. Each successful shot increments the player’s score. After being shot, spiders will respawn at different locations on the same surface.
5. **Scoring:** The player’s score increases with each spider shot. The goal is to shoot as many spiders as possible to achieve a high score.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/3D-AR-Spider-Shooting-Game.git
   ```
2. **Open in Unity:**
   - Open Unity Hub.
   - Click on “Add,” navigate to the cloned project directory, and select it.
   - Open the project in Unity.
3. **Build and Run:**
   - Make sure your target platform is set to Android or iOS (depending on your device).
   - Build the project and deploy it to your mobile device.

## Requirements

- **Unity 2020.3 or higher** (with AR Foundation package installed)
